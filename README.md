Figs plan:
1a Trend in share uninsured
1b Trend in share on medicaid
2, 3a/b, Trend in share uninsured/smoking/inactive, by states that expanded in 2014 and those that haven't expanded
4, 5a/b Same as 1a/b except for young
6, 7a/7b Same as 1a/b except for non-college

Tables (or basically, which models am I estimating?):
Smoking full population (weighted/unweighted, with and without covariates)
Inactivity full population (weighted/unweighted, with and without covariates)
Smoking young (weighted/unweighted, with and without covariates)
Inactivity young (weighted/unweighted, with and without covariates)
Smoking non-college (weighted/unweighted, with and without covariates)
Inactivity non-college (weighted/unweighted, with and without covariates)

Associated with each of these tables (in an appendix), have a set of four figures with event study plots
